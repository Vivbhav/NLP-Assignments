Motivation: The motivation of this assignment is to obtain probability distribution for each class of NER model. 
Consider 7-class stanford NER model.

Problem Statement : The goal of the assignment is to find probability distribution for each class of NER model 
that is used in earlier assignmnet.Do certain observations to determine patterns (or context) information for each class.

The Task: You need to use the Named Entity labelled corpus of earlier assignment and determine probability
distribution for each class and pattern observed for each class.

Output File: Probability distribution for each class. Pattern observed for each class

 Submit the following:

1)  Labeled corpus of all classes of form <named-entity>_class-label.  

     Example: Input sentence of corpus: Ram is studying in College of Engineering Pune locatd in Pune.

    Output file: NER_labelled_Corpus_MISNO.txt  

     Ram_PER

     College of Engineering Pune_ORG

     Pune_LOC

     2) Statistics of Probability Distribution for each class. File name: Stat_NER_MISNO.txt

     3)  Patterns observed. File name:  Pattern_Classname_MISNO.txt

          File name example: Pattern_PER_MISNO.txt, Pattern_ORG_MISNO.txt and so on...
