He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded . 
The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear . 
A century of exploration had established that a great land mass , North and South America , lay between Europe and the Indies . 
One by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded . 
In fact , Hudson's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes . 
But there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to the north . 
Nearly twenty-five years before , Captain John Davis had noted , as he sailed near the Arctic Circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirling and roaring , as it were the meeting of tides '' . 
He named this opening , between Baffin Island and Labrador , the `` Furious Overfall '' . 
( Later , it was to be called Hudson Strait . 
) In 1602 , George Waymouth , in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back .
